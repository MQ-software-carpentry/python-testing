Learners should use their existing setup from their previous Software Carpentry
lesson (if any). Additionally, learners should have installed pytest, and
ensured that they can run it. See the course page for more details about how to
setup Python, Git Bash and pytest.

Learners should create a folder to work in for the lesson (via `mkdir`). We
recommend calling the folder `python-testing`.
